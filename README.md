This project is a frontend full-stack application developed as a test project to evaluate frontend development skills. It integrates a frontend ReactJS interface with a mock REST API to perform CRUD operations on song data

Technologies Used :

ReactJS: Frontend framework used to build the user interface.
Redux Toolkit: State management library employed to manage the application's state.
Redux-Saga: Middleware utilized for asynchronous actions, particularly making calls to the REST API.
Emotion and Styled System: Styling tools are used to design and style the application components.

Features
Display a list of songs fetched from a mock REST API ( JSONPlaceholder).
Enable clients to perform CRUD operations on songs:
Create new songs
Update existing songs
Delete songs


Note: The update and add functionalities mimic the actions and do not directly interact with a database since a mock REST API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) is used. This means that while you can interact with the interface to update or add songs, these actions do not persist changes to an actual database.
